Policy to manage aspects of the =apt= package manager.

** Modules

*** apt-pin-packages
- *Bundle* - =apt:pin_packages=

This module handles managing package pin configurations for a set of packages. It leverages =library-apt-pin-package-version-priority=. Its primarily configured by the variable =apt:pin_packages.config=. This module is designed to integrate well with CFEngine Build module inputs, group data, and host specific data in CFEngine Enterprise Mission Portal as illustrated by the following screen shots.

Here we can see Groups defined for Ubuntu:
[[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nickanderson/cfengine-apt/main/media/ubuntu-groups.png]]

Here we can see the =Ubuntu= group (all hosts reporting the =ubuntu= class with configuration to pin =mdadm=:
[[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nickanderson/cfengine-apt/main/media/ubuntu-pin-mdadm.png]]

Here we can see the =Ubuntu= group (all hosts reporting the =ubuntu= class with configuration to pin =ufw=:
[[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nickanderson/cfengine-apt/main/media/ubuntu-22-pin-ufw.png]]

And here we can see the behavior of ~apt~ before and after application of the policy on an Ubuntu 22 host. Notice that =mdadm= and =ufw= are no longer available upgrades:

*** library-apt-pin-package-version-priority
- *Bundle* - =apt:package_version_priority_pinned(name, version, priority, state)=
- =name= - The name of the package.

** Variables
- =apt:package_version_priority_pinned.preferences_dir= - String setting the directory where configuration files for apt package pinning should be managed. Defaults to =/etc/apt/preferences.d/=. This is primarily used for testing so that the target system is unaffected.
